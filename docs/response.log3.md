# Response Log for E-commerce Application

## Response on 2023-06-26: Implemented OAuth2 Authentication

### Issue Description
The application needed a robust OAuth2 authentication system to allow users to sign in using third-party providers like Google, Facebook, and GitHub. This required implementing several components to handle the OAuth2 flow and process user information from different providers.

### Solution Implemented
A complete OAuth2 authentication flow was implemented for the e-commerce application with the following components:

1. **OAuth2UserInfo and its implementations**: These classes extract user information from different OAuth2 providers (Google, Facebook, GitHub) which have different response formats.

2. **OAuth2UserInfoFactory**: Creates the appropriate OAuth2UserInfo implementation based on the provider.

3. **CustomOAuth2User**: A custom implementation of Spring's OAuth2User that includes additional user information from your database.

4. **AuthProvider enum**: Defines the supported authentication providers (LOCAL, GOOGLE, FACEBOOK, GITHUB).

5. **CustomOAuth2UserService**: Processes the OAuth2 authentication, either creating a new user or updating an existing one.

### Best Practices Applied
This implementation follows best practices for OAuth2 authentication in Spring Boot:

- **Separation of concerns**: Provider-specific logic is separated into dedicated classes
- **User management**: It handles both new and returning users appropriately
- **Data mapping**: It properly maps OAuth2 user attributes to the application's user model
- **Error handling**: It includes appropriate error handling for OAuth2 authentication failures
- **Security**: It validates email presence and prevents provider conflicts

### Benefits
With these changes, the application can now:

1. Authenticate users via multiple OAuth2 providers (Google, Facebook, GitHub)
2. Create new user accounts automatically for first-time OAuth2 users
3. Update existing user information when returning OAuth2 users log in
4. Maintain a consistent user experience across different authentication methods
5. Handle provider-specific data formats transparently

### Implementation Details
- The `CustomOAuth2UserService` extends Spring's `DefaultOAuth2UserService`
- User information is extracted using provider-specific implementations of `OAuth2UserInfo`
- New users are assigned a default "USER" role
- Existing users are updated with the latest information from the OAuth2 provider
- Appropriate exceptions are thrown for authentication failures

This implementation enhances the application's authentication capabilities while maintaining security and providing a seamless user experience.

## Stripe Webhook Integration Summary

## What Was Implemented

1. **Stripe Webhook Endpoint:**
   - Created `StripeWebhookController` to handle Stripe webhook events for `payment_intent.succeeded` and `payment_intent.payment_failed`.
   - Endpoint verifies the Stripe signature for security.

2. **Payment & Order Status Update:**
   - On `payment_intent.succeeded`, the associated `Payment` record is updated to `SUCCESS` and the `Order` status is set to `PAID`.
   - On `payment_intent.payment_failed`, the `Payment` record is updated to `FAILED` with error info.

3. **Entity Improvements:**
   - Implemented the `Payment` entity with fields for order, paymentIntentId, clientSecret, status, failure info, createdAt, and updatedAt.

4. **Best Practices:**
   - Webhook endpoint is protected by Stripe signature verification.
   - Status changes are transactional and idempotent.

## Next Steps / Testing
- Run the application and use Stripe CLI or dashboard to send test webhook events.
- Check that payment and order statuses update accordingly in the database.
